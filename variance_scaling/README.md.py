Data and analysis shown in Figure 2 (and associated supplemental figures)
data_d0.csv - raw data from day 0
data_d1_{}.csv - raw data from day 1
plot_scaling.py - calculates and plots mean-variance scaling behaviors
plot_correlation.py - calculates and plots abundance correlation
bootstrapping_powerlaws.py - calculates unconstrained power-law exponents for mean-variance scaling behaviors, along with performing standard bootstrapping (for CIs). Output is powerlawexps_boot.csv
bootstrapping_powerlaws_plot.py - plots unconstrained power-law exponents for mean-variance scaling behaviors
