Data and analysis shown in Figure 7 (and associated supplemental figures)
get_frequencies.py - Process publicly available data from Venkataram et al. (2016) Cell. Outputs barcode frequencies in file frequencies.csv
msd_log_calc.py - calculate mean-squared displacement (MSD) of log-transformed frequencies for each batch. Outputs in folder msd_outputs.
plot_msd.py - plots MSD for each batch.
plot_rawdisplacements.py - plots frequency displacements over pairs of timepoints
scaling_var.py - mean-variance scaling behaviors
